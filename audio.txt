#Frequency: 
Frequency is just the number of vibrations per second

1 Vibration per second = 1 Hz (Low pitch)
11,025 Vibrations per second = 11,025 Hz (High pitch)


=>Sampling Rate: 
If your sampling rate is 22 kHz, the "highest pitch" (frequency) sound you can record is 11 kHz.
$$22,050 \text{ dots} \div 2 = 11,025 \text{ vibrations}$$

Sampling Rate: The bucket of dots you have
Frequency: The actual waves you build with those dots.
Rule: The waves can never be faster than half the bucket speed.
